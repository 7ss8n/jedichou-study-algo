 * Description  :
 *  Program 12.5 Investigating the family.
 *
 *  To exercise your newfound skills with files, you can create a revised version
 *  of Program 11.6 from the previous chapter to allow you to keep a dossier on
 *  family members. In this case, you'll create a file containing data on all
 *  family members, and then you'll process the file to output data on each member
 *  and that member's parents. The Structures used only extend to a minimum range
 *  of members in each case. You can, of course, embellish these to hold kind of
 *  scuttlebutt you like on your relatives.
